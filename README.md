# About

This is a thing I'm working on just for fun. I wanted to do some more stuff with unsafe Rust and data structures. 
I read a while ago about Facebook's implementation of a C++ vector, and I could not find such an implementation
in Rust. This is not to say that it is necessary; I am just working on it because I want to.


# Source Docs
These are some of the docs that I am using:
1. [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec/)
2. [The fbvec github](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/docs/FBVector.md)
